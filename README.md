<h3> 1 - 217. Contains Duplicate </h3>

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] <br>
Output: true
```
```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] <br>

<h3> 2 - 9. Polindrome Number </h3>

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
```
Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
```
Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

<h3> 3 - 242. Valid Anagram </h3>

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
```
Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
